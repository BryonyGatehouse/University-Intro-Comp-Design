# Introduction to Computer Program Design
This course introduces the fundamentals of programming in a high-level programming language (Java), using an object oriented approach to program design. Students develop their programming skills by constructing computer programs for a variety of applications. The course provides a foundation for all later courses in computer science, and develops programming skills useful for students in many other disciplines.

### Course content
COMP 102 is about the design and construction of computer programs. The course forms a basis for later courses in Computer Science and Engineering, but will also be useful for students who want to learn computer programming but do not intend to study this subject at higher levels.
### Course learning objectives
Students who pass this course should be able to:
1. Read, comprehend, design, and construct small programs using the Java programming language and an object-oriented design approach.
